Login Authentication System 
A Login Authentication System is a security feature that verifies a user’s identity before granting access to an application. It allows users to log in using a username and password, ensuring that only authorized people can access private data or features.
A Login Authentication System works in simple steps:
 User Input: The user enters their username and password on the login page.
 Verification: The system checks the entered details against the stored data in the database.
 Authentication:
If the credentials match, access is granted.
If they don’t match, access is denied with an error message.
 Session Creation: Once logged in, a session or token is created to keep the user authenticated until they log out.
 Features of Login Authentication System:
Secure login/logout, user registration, password encryption, forgot password option, session management, and role-based access control.
Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js / Express.js
Database: MySQL / MongoDB
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token) or Session-based authentication
Conclusion:
A Login Authentication System ensures secure access, protects user data, and allows only authorized users to use the application efficiently.
